# We are still using a checked in version of the python flatbuffer bindings
# for the bazel build to keep it consistent with the Makefile build. And
# the bazel target is called schema_py so that the shared TfLite/TFLM code
# does not need any change.
#
# We have a second schema_py_generate bazel target so that TFLM can create
# its own version of the bindings from schema.fbs. This is mostly used as part
# of the nightly sync from upstream TF.

# TODO(b/243587789): Update so we only need one schema_py target (which will
# generate the schemas). May need to update some dependencies in BUILD files.
