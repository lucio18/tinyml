# TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers

The TFLM code is currently in the process of being refactored out of the
[Tensorflow github
repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/micro)
into a standalone repo. This refactoring is currently in the initial stages and
is expected to be completed towards the end of June 2021.
